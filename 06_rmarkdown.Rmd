We are using R Markdown quite extensively here at Marcus Institute. In short, R Markdown provides us a quite easy way to combine R codes, plots, tables and descriptive texts in one report. In fact, this tutorial you are reading right now is a product of R Markdown. If you go to your address bar and replace the final part ".html" with ".Rmd", you will be able to see the source ".Rmd" file.
