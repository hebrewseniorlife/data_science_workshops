It is impossible to cover all of data visualization within one chapter. Here, we provide a basic demonstration of how to use `ggplot2` & `plotly` to create figures easily in R. We will show you how to design and create some common figures, but what you need is to learn by doing. Thanks to the rich community of `ggplot2`, you can always find good support online if you ever run into problems in the future. 

# ggplot2
## Grammar of Graphics Fundementals
Let's start with a basic example of using `ggplot2`. For this example, we are going to use the `iris` data set. 
```{r}
head(iris)
```


```{r, message = F}
library(tidyverse)

ggplot(iris, aes(x = Sepal.Length, y = Petal.Length, color = Species)) +
  geom_point(shape = 2)
```

`ggplot` understands graphics in a very artistic way:

> Plot = A canvas + Different layers of visuals

When we are creating a ggplot, we always start with a `ggplot` function, which gives us a canvas. In fact, if you run the `ggplot()` function on its own, you will get a blank plot. 

```{r}
ggplot()
```

Layers of visuals in `ggplot2` are called `geom`. The `geom` provides some pre-defined rules on how the points, lines or shapes should be drawn. For example, the `geom_point()` function we used previously contains instructions for how to draw a layer of points, which basically tells R that you want to use your data to draw a scatter plot. So far, there are `r length(grep("^geom_", ls("package:ggplot2"), value = T))` pre-defined geoms available in `ggplot2` for you to choose. In most cases, these geom will cover most of what you need and satisfy most of your imagination. If you need more, there are plenty of `ggplot2` extension packages online. Some of them do provide additional geoms. You can find a list of these extension package on this website: [https://www.ggplot2-exts.org](https://www.ggplot2-exts.org)

Geoms in base ggplot2:
```{r, echo=FALSE}
grep("^geom_", ls("package:ggplot2"), value = T)
```

You can add multiple layers of geoms into the same plot. In the example below, we are adding a semi-transparent path line on top of the points layer. Note that the path geom also uses the "data" and x-y definitions we defined in the `ggplot()` function. 
```{r}
ggplot(iris, aes(x = Sepal.Length, y = Petal.Length, color = Species)) +
  geom_point(shape = 2) + 
  geom_path(alpha = 0.4)
```


You can also find hints on which geom to use by checking out the `ggplot2` cheatsheet. You can find one here:

![https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/blob/master/data-visualization-2.1.pdf](images/data-visualization-2.1.png)

It is also critically important to understand where to put "variables". Let's take a look at example 1 again. There are 3 kinds of variables here: 

- **data**: The first variable in `ggplot()` or inside `data = ` in any `geoms`.
- **variable aesthetics**: Variables defined within `aes()`
- **constant aesthetics**: variables defined outside `aes()` 

```{r}
ggplot(iris, aes(x = Sepal.Length, y = Petal.Length, color = Species)) +
  geom_point(shape = 2)
```

The `data` and `aes()` defined in `ggplot()` globally affects the entire "canvas". You can also define them locally within each `geom`. This is especially helpful if you want to add a layer of data, which was not included in the orginal dataset. 

```{r, eval = F}
# The previous example can be rewritten as below.
ggplot() +
  geom_point(data = iris, aes(x = Sepal.Length, y = Petal.Length, color = Species), 
             shape = 2)
```

## Scale
In previous examples, we have used the `aes()` function to assign data into several aesthetic aspects, such as the x & y axis. Common aesthetic variable include:

- x
- y
- color/colour
- fill
- alpha
- size
- linetype
- shape

The default settings in `ggplot` works in certain ways but we always want to be able to customize these settings. In fact, these aesthetic aspects can then be further customized using the family of `scale` function. Here we list out all scale functions in base ggplot2:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
grep("^scale_", ls("package:ggplot2"), value = T)
```

You can simply "add" these scale functions into your ggplot calls. 
```{r}
ggplot(iris, aes(x = Sepal.Length, y = Petal.Length, color = Species)) +
  geom_point(shape = 2) + 
  geom_path(alpha = 0.4) +
  scale_x_log10() + # log transformation for x axis
  scale_y_reverse() + # reverse y axis
  scale_color_viridis_d() # viridis color makes plots look scientific. 
                          # _d means discrete. _c means continuous.
```

## Coorinate
Although `scale` can modify axes, these modifications belong to the individual axis. If what you want to change is something beyond that, for example, the relationship/layout between the axes, you need to use the `coord_` coordinate function family.

For example, `coord_polar()` will squeeze the axes and transform the plot into a radar plot whereas `coord_fixed()` will force the two axes to use the same scale to show their 1:1 (or customized) relationship. What I find most useful is the `coord_flip()` function, which can flip the x-y axis. This is really helpful when you make a forest plot. 

```{r}
ggplot(iris, aes(x = Sepal.Length, y = Petal.Length, color = Species)) +
  geom_point(shape = 2) + 
  geom_path(alpha = 0.4) +
  scale_color_viridis_d() +
  coord_polar()
```

```{r}
ggplot(iris, aes(x = Sepal.Length, y = Petal.Length, color = Species)) +
  geom_point(shape = 2) + 
  geom_path(alpha = 0.4) +
  scale_color_viridis_d() +
  coord_fixed()
```

```{r}
ggplot(iris, aes(x = Sepal.Length, y = Petal.Length, color = Species)) +
  geom_point(shape = 2) + 
  geom_path(alpha = 0.4) +
  scale_color_viridis_d() +
  coord_flip()
```

## Facets
Facets in ggplots refer to multiple subpanels of the "same" plot. It can be done through the `facet_grid()` (2D) or `face_wrap()` (1D) functions. 

```{r}
ggplot(iris, aes(x = Sepal.Length, y = Petal.Length, color = Species)) +
  geom_point(shape = 2) + 
  geom_path(alpha = 0.4) +
  scale_color_viridis_d() +
  facet_wrap(~Species)
```

## Theme
### `theme_` family
Theme in `ggplot` controls how the plot will look in general, including the color of the panel and the font of the axis. `ggplot2` comes with a few pre-defined themes. You can access them through the `theme_` prefix. For example, `theme_minimal` will remove the gray background and borders from the default of ggplot2. 

```{r}
ggplot(iris, aes(x = Sepal.Length, y = Petal.Length, color = Species)) +
  geom_point(shape = 2) + 
  geom_path(alpha = 0.4) +
  scale_color_viridis_d() +
  theme_minimal()
```

Here at the Marcus Institute, we developed our own theme called `razor`.

```{r}
library(ggrazor)

ggplot(iris, aes(x = Sepal.Length, y = Petal.Length, color = Species)) +
  geom_point(shape = 2) + 
  geom_path(alpha = 0.4) +
  scale_color_viridis_d() +
  theme_razor() +
  # you can add additional stuff to make it look better.
  theme(axis.line = element_blank()) +
  ggthemes::geom_rangeframe(data = data.frame(x = c(4, 8), y = c(2, 6)),
                            aes(x, y), color = "#7F7F7F", show.legend = F)
```

### `theme()` function
If you want to customize the theme in detail, which we usually do, you need to use the theme function. Here is a reference page of what you can do but in most cases, you can find what you need via auto-complete in RStudio. 

[https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/ggtheme.html](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/ggtheme.html)

## Position dodge/jitter
Most `geom`s come with a position argument. You can adjust the position of the points/bars a little so that they are not over lapping. However, dodge/jitter do not only help you get away with overlapping points, they can also help you make clustered plots. 

```{r}
iris_sum <- iris %>%
  gather("key", "value", -Species) %>%
  group_by(Species, key) %>%
  summarise(mean = mean(value),
            sd = sd(value)) %>%
  mutate(low = mean - 1.96 * sd, high = mean + 1.96 * sd)
head(iris_sum)
```


```{r}
ggplot(iris_sum, aes(x = Species, y = mean, ymin = low, ymax = high,
                     color = key)) +
  geom_pointrange(position = position_dodge(0.5)) +
  geom_text(aes(label = key), 
            position = position_dodge(0.5), vjust = 1.5) +
  scale_color_viridis_d() +
  coord_flip() +
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  theme_classic() +
  theme(
    axis.line.y = element_blank(),
    axis.ticks.y = element_blank()
  ) +
  labs(x = NULL)
```

## Multi-plot panel
There are a number of ways to combine multiple ggplots into one and `cowplot` is one of the bests. Note that this package will change the default theme of `ggplot` to the classic one due to the author's preference. 

```{r}
library(cowplot)

p1 <- ggplot(iris, aes(x = Sepal.Length, y = Petal.Length, color = Species)) +
  geom_point(shape = 2) + 
  geom_path(alpha = 0.4) +
  scale_color_viridis_d() +
  theme(legend.position = "none")

p2 <- ggplot(iris_sum, aes(x = Species, y = mean, ymin = low, ymax = high,
                     color = key)) +
  geom_pointrange(position = position_dodge(0.5)) +
  geom_text(aes(label = key), 
            position = position_dodge(0.5), vjust = 1.5) +
  scale_color_viridis_d() +
  coord_flip() +
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  theme_classic() +
  theme(
    axis.line.y = element_blank(),
    axis.ticks.y = element_blank()
  ) +
  labs(x = NULL) +
  theme(legend.position = "none")

plot_grid(p1, p2, labels = c("A)", "B)"))
```

## Save/Export plot
`ggplot2` comes with an `ggsave` function, which makes it really easy to save the plots you generated into png, jpg, tiff, pdf, svg, & etc. By default, it will save the last plot but you can choose to save any saved ggplot. 

```{r, eval = F}
ggsave("myplot.png", width = 9, height = 5, units = "inch", dpi = 300)
```

## Common Figures

### Bar plot with error bar
```{r}
ggplot(iris_sum, aes(x = Species, y = mean)) +
  geom_bar(aes(fill = key), stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = low, ymax = high, group = key),
                position = position_dodge(0.9), width = 0.3) +
  geom_text(aes(label = round(mean, 1), group = key), 
            position = position_dodge(0.9), vjust = -0.1, hjust = -0.1) +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette="OrRd") +
  labs(x = NULL, y = "Length") +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")
```

### Forest Plot
```{r}
iris_sum2 <- iris_sum %>%
  mutate(name = paste(Species, key, sep = "."))

ggplot(iris_sum2, aes(x = name, y = mean, ymin = low, ymax = high)) +
  geom_pointrange() +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, linetype = 2) +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(x = NULL, y = NULL) +
  theme_classic() +
  theme(
    axis.line.y = element_blank(),
    axis.ticks.y = element_blank()
  )
```
