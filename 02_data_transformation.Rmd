`Tidyverse` is a collection of 8 awesome R packages, including:

- `dplyr`: Data manipulation (Chapter 2)
- `tidyr`: Data Long/Wide Transformation (Chapter 2)
- `purrr`: List-based manipulation (Chapter 2)
- `tibble`: Improved version of data.frame (Chapter 1)
- `readr`: Improved data reading methods (Chapter 3)
- `stringr`: String Operations using regular expression
- `forcats`: Categorical Analyses
- `ggplot2`: Data Visualizations with a set of grammar (Chapter 5)

In this chapter, since we will talk about data transformation, we will focus on `dplyr` and `tidyr`. We will also give a basic introduction to list-based analyses using `purrr` at the very end. For the rest of the packages, we will learn as we proceed forward. 

# Tidy data
One of the greatest inventions of `tidyverse` is that it comes up with theory that describes the general practice of a includes a set of verbs to describe the process of "data transformation".
