This site includes materials for the Data Science with R Workshop Series hosted by Marcus Institute. All the materials are developed by the Biostats and Data Science group at Marcus Institute. We aim to provide trainings to our own group numbers and individuals who are interested in doing data science works using R.

- [Chapter 1 - R Programming Fundamentals](01_getting_started.html)
- Chapter 2 - Data Transformation using Tidyverse
- Chapter 3 - Access Database from R
- Chapter 4 - Statistical Models in R
- Chapter 5 - Data Visualization using ggplot2 & plotly
- Chapter 6 - Tabular Visualization using kableExtra
- Chapter 7 - Assembling Everything in R Markdown Reports
- Chapter 8 - Creating Interactive Web Apps using R Shiny

Chapter 1 & 2 are fundamentals, which you are not recommended to skip. Chapter 3-8 don't have to be read in order, although consuming them one by one is still recommended.
